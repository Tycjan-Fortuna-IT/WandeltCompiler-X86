# WandeltCompiler Examples

This section provides example programs written in the Wandelt language, along with their intermediate representation (IR) outputs and x86 assembly outputs. These examples are compiled using the WandeltCompiler.

## Overview

The WandeltCompiler is a powerful tool designed to compile programs written in the Wandelt language. It generates an intermediate representation (IR) of the code, which is a lower-level representation used for further processing and optimization. Additionally, it produces x86 assembly code, which can be directly executed on x86 architecture.

## Example Programs

Below are some example programs written in Wandelt, along with their corresponding IR and x86 assembly outputs. These outputs are not yet optimized, providing a clear view of the initial compilation stage.
